It's been a very difficult process with a lot of trial and error. Last night, however, I had my first big success imaging M31, pictured above. This final view is approximately 5-10 minutes of total exposure time, but the intent of EAA is to offer near-real-time views of dark sky objects. M31 is generally an easy target because it's so bright and large, but this was the first time I got a good image. After months of giving up and restarting, the work finally paid off.</p>\n<p>This is going to be a great setup to take out for public observing. For objects like Saturn and Jupiter I still prefer a regular telescope with an eyepiece because people seem to have a visceral connection seeing them that way. But the dimmer objects like galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters rarely resolve to anything more than \"dim fuzzies\" under city skies, even in large telescopes. EAA allows people to see these objects closer to what they actually look like in long-exposure photography. It's a fantastic tool to get people interested.</p>\n<p>I was able to capture several other objects during the evening.

That day was awful, and I certainly want those who were lost and the heroes that emerged to be remembered. I also feel like it was our responsibility to find those responsible and bring them to justice. However, so much evil was done by our country in the name of retribution that I can't fully embrace it. The US has always had a problematic past when it comes to the treatment of others. 9/11 was an excuse for those who already had hate in their heart to put that hate into action. As a result we fabricated evidence and used it to invade a country that wasn't even involved. It essentially gave Bush Jr. an opportunity to finish the war his father started and lost, over oil. That day marked a change in our politics that led to extremism in conservative circles. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib are atrocities that our politicians enabled in the name of justice. It sickens me that we became monsters willingly in order to feel safer.</p>",

There's no real intelligence there, and these systems aren't thinking for themselves. We've just gotten very good at training these large language models to write text that sounds like a person wrote it. But what we CAN do is still pretty cool. Here's an example of the output you get when I asked it to write a summary for \"The Uncanny Counter\".</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3PtmgZN3jhU?si=pl5jAlpb5AtVRyqn\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Yesterday I finally got back into the astronomy groove. After dreading the thought that it might cost another couple hundred dollars to fix the mount on which I already spent hundreds of dollars, I took a closer look at the issue and found it was simply a gear on the RA motor that had been knocked slightly out of place. A few minor adjustments and everything was back in working order. After months of anxiety and doubt about whether or not to continue with this often frustrating hobby, finally a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>That led to a fun evening of public outreach with the astronomy club. Despite an unfortunate setup site location (we can't see through trees, folks) we had a good turnout for the event at Miami Whitewater Forest. Lots of kids and families with a lot of interest. A few gasps from those who stayed late enough to see Saturn. One family almost \"bought\" a member's telescope when their kid tried to yeet (as the young people say) the tube backwards off the mount. A friendly but stern talking-to settled anyone else who might have been too amped-up about the universe.</p>\n<p>This means that tonight, weather permitting, I'll be able to setup the full rig with the camera and get back into EAA (electronically assisted astronomy - pictured above). The goal is to get the setup reliable enough that I can use it for public events. Polar alignment is the main issue as my process hasn't been very consistent so far. I should be able to pick up where I was and get some decent live images like below.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0120.JPG\" data-size=\"1080x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0120-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"The Moon\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Moon</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0126.jpeg\" data-size=\"2732x2048\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0126-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"The Whirlpool Galaxy\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Whirlpool Galaxy</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0141.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0141-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"The Needle Galaxy\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Needle Galaxy</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0147.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0147-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"The Ring Nebula\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Ring Nebula</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0105.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0105-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"The Dumbell Nebula\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Dumbell Nebula</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0109.jpg\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0109-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The Andromeda Galaxy\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Andromeda Galaxy</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0110.jpg\" data-size=\"2732x2048\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/10/gallery/IMG_0110-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"M13 The Hercules Cluster\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>M13 The Hercules Cluster</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>For those interested, this setup uses a SkyQuest EQ mount, Svbony 80mm doublet refractor, ASI planetary camera (non-cooled), and the ASI Air Plus to control and capture.
