It's been a very difficult process with a lot of trial and error. Last night, however, I had my first big success imaging M31, pictured above. This final view is approximately 5-10 minutes of total exposure time, but the intent of EAA is to offer near-real-time views of dark sky objects. M31 is generally an easy target because it's so bright and large, but this was the first time I got a good image. After months of giving up and restarting, the work finally paid off.</p>\n<p>This is going to be a great setup to take out for public observing. For objects like Saturn and Jupiter I still prefer a regular telescope with an eyepiece because people seem to have a visceral connection seeing them that way. But the dimmer objects like galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters rarely resolve to anything more than \"dim fuzzies\" under city skies, even in large telescopes. EAA allows people to see these objects closer to what they actually look like in long-exposure photography. It's a fantastic tool to get people interested.</p>\n<p>I was able to capture several other objects during the evening. Here's a few of the best.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0155.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0155-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0156.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0156-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0159.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0159-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0160.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0160-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0162.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0162-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0166.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0166-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0170.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0170-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0171.PNG\" data-size=\"1366x1024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://davidwk.io/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_0171-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>",

That day was awful, and I certainly want those who were lost and the heroes that emerged to be remembered. I also feel like it was our responsibility to find those responsible and bring them to justice. However, so much evil was done by our country in the name of retribution that I can't fully embrace it. The US has always had a problematic past when it comes to the treatment of others. 9/11 was an excuse for those who already had hate in their heart to put that hate into action. As a result we fabricated evidence and used it to invade a country that wasn't even involved. It essentially gave Bush Jr. an opportunity to finish the war his father started and lost, over oil. That day marked a change in our politics that led to extremism in conservative circles. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib are atrocities that our politicians enabled in the name of justice. It sickens me that we became monsters willingly in order to feel safer.</p>",

After dreading the thought that it might cost another couple hundred dollars to fix the mount on which I already spent hundreds of dollars, I took a closer look at the issue and found it was simply a gear on the RA motor that had been knocked slightly out of place. A few minor adjustments and everything was back in working order. After months of anxiety and doubt about whether or not to continue with this often frustrating hobby, finally a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>That led to a fun evening of public outreach with the astronomy club. Despite an unfortunate setup site location (we can't see through trees, folks) we had a good turnout for the event at Miami Whitewater Forest. Lots of kids and families with a lot of interest. A few gasps from those who stayed late enough to see Saturn. One family almost \"bought\" a member's telescope when their kid tried to yeet (as the young people say) the tube backwards off the mount. A friendly but stern talking-to settled anyone else who might have been too amped-up about the universe.</p>\n<p>This means that tonight, weather permitting, I'll be able to setup the full rig with the camera and get back into EAA (electronically assisted astronomy - pictured above). The goal is to get the setup reliable enough that I can use it for public events. Polar alignment is the main issue as my process hasn't been very consistent so far.

            "content_html": "<p>It's a huge week for K-Drama fans in America as the last two episodes of \"The Uncanny Counter\" season 2 get released. Rather than bitch that it's not the usual 16 episode season, I'm going to be happy that I got to see 12 more episodes of this fantastic show. Later this month we get \"A Time Called You\" which, if the trailer is accurate, is going to destroy a lot of us fans, emotionally speaking.</p>\n<p>And on the subject of South Korea, my favorite country I've never been to, I read a fairly alarming article about how the birth rate, which is already the lowest in the world, has dropped once again. Science says a population needs a fertility rate of over 2% to sustain itself. South Korea's stands at 0.78%. Yikes! <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/worlds-lowest-birthrate-sinks-further-despite-cash-payouts-to-parents-23a92210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the article</a>.</p>\n<p>It's a long weekend here in the US. It's Labor Day, which is traditionally the holiday dumb-ass Trumpers confuse with Memorial Day. That means we can expect the usual deluge of \"While you're stuffing your face at a cookout you libtards better not forget the soldiers who died so you could have the day off!\" posts. (FYI libtards is their word, not mine. I'm just using it to accurately represent the level of maturity in their social media.)</p>\n<p>I've been contemplating my career a bit lately, mostly as a result of my (first at this company) bad review from last year. A whole plethora (do you know what a plethora is?) of circumstances culminated in that particular situation, including some mental health setbacks. However there was some feedback from a peer on that review that was entirely false. I guess I was naive to think I'm too old to make enemies at work. But to the point, I've been considering whether or not I'm in the right role for myself at this point in time. It doesn't bring me the sense of accomplishment that it once did. I don't want to leave the company at all - it's a great place to work. But it's big enough that I could find something else that might make me happier.Â </p>\n<p>Yesterday the weather was so nice that, for a moment, I forgot about how fucked we are for continuing to destroy the environment. Please visualize that GIF of Nicolas Cage smiling, wind blowing through his hair in \"Con-Air\" for context. Watching Kid 5's soccer practice was a little less skin-cancerish for once.</p>\n<p>Â </p>",

With the right kind of stimulant, I'm the person I want to be - confident, pro-active, productive, outgoing. Vyvanse, the stuff I was taking before, was total shit for me. It did nothing but increase my anxiety and dull my personality.Â </p>\n<p>I don't know how it's possible, but I lost 5 more pounds. I'm still in fat-ass territory, but I'm lucky to be at this point with the way I've been eating lately. I wish there was a coma diet. Just put me under for a couple months and feed me intravenously.Â </p>\n<p>Yesterday in the office was pretty good. Got to meet some people face to face for the first time, saw a few work friends, and saw a lot of people from my old team. Free food was a bonus. It's a shame, though...they completely remodeled the office with all this great collaboration equipment, but it rarely gets used. Not that I want to go back full time (the drive sucks), but I hate to see it go to waste.</p>\n<p>It's a story too long to tell, but I've been dealing with a charge for training that I wasn't supposed to pay for. My part was $400, but through a series of unfortunate clicks, I paid $3600. The refund is somewhere between PayPal and my bank, a kind of purgatory that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.Â </p>\n<p>I'm diving deeper into automation with Power Automate and Teams at work. Not my job, but a skill that really helps me streamline things for my team. Going to start taking some training and impress the shit out of people.</p>\n<p>Fun note: go check out <a href=\"https://ideogram.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ideogram.ai</a>.
