It started with “Squid Game”, but it didn’t take me long to deep-dive into the enormous K-Drama library on Netflix. “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” was the show that really hooked me. Since then, most of my streaming time has been spent on South Korean television. </p>\n<p>I’m going to be slowly expanding this list to include my thoughts on each show, and I’ll be using tags to help others sort through them and find things they like. For now, and without any spoilers, here are some quick recommendations.
