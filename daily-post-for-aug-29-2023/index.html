This will likely be interesting to no one but me, and even that's questionable. But I've found in the past that a daily brain-dump can help clear out the cobwebs, especially when I've got a lot going on. Fair warning - this is mostly going to be verbal salad. A lot of random thoughts that aren't necessarily related.</p><p>Room painting has been the major project the past few weekends. My office, Kid 5's room, and the upstairs bathroom. I hate painting. The taping alone is awful, let alone the actual process. But the final result makes it worth the effort. Maybe.</p><p>Getting this blog setup has also been a project. A more enjoyable one, at that. I tinkered with <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro CMS</a> and I really liked it, but it's overkill for someone who just wants a simple blog. Plus it reminded me that, although I have a web development background, my brain isn't really condusive to solving nit-picky little code issues. In the end, <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii</a> was the best option for me. It works with GitHub Pages and has a nice, easy-to-use interface.Â </p><p>The hate-crime shooting in Jacksonville reminded me, once again, why I left that god-forsaken place. I still claim the Jaguars but not much else. It's a town full of douchebag CEOs and poor white trash masquerading as the middle class. It's got a lot of "angry white guy" energy. I don't miss it.</p><p>Started a couple of new shows in the K-Drama category: "Law School" and "Memories of the Alhambra". I'm not sure I'm going to like either of them because they both have a very "American" style. It's similar to why I haven't returned to "Vagabond" yet (even the presence of Bae Suzy hasn't coerced me yet). The quirkiness is what I love about South Korean television. If I want to watch an over-stylized, loud show with murder, explosions, and no self-awareness, I'd watch any of the scripted programs on NBC.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2023-08-29T11:49">August 29, 2023</time></div><div class="post__tag"><span>Tags:</span><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://davidwk.com/tags/daily/" title="daily">daily</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__meta"><div class="post__meta__share"><h3>Share this:</h3></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer section"><div class="footer__inner"><a class="logo footer__logo" href="https://davidwk.com/">David WK</a><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button class="footer__bttop js-scroll-to-top" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://davidwk.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://davidwk.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=6ee59465c67403142e643120f27f91df"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
