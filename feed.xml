                <p>Monday was the anniversary of 9/11. I have very mixed feelings about that particular day. That day was awful, and I certainly want those who were lost and the heroes that emerged to be remembered. I also feel like it was our responsibility to find those responsible and bring them to justice. However, so much evil was done by our country in the name of retribution that I can't fully embrace it. The US has always had a problematic past when it comes to the treatment of others. 9/11 was an excuse for those who already had hate in their heart to put that hate into action. As a result we fabricated evidence and used it to invade a country that wasn't even involved. It essentially gave Bush Jr. an opportunity to finish the war his father started and lost, over oil. That day marked a change in our politics that led to extremism in conservative circles. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib are atrocities that our politicians enabled in the name of justice. It sickens me that we became monsters willingly in order to feel safer.</p>

                <p>I'm starting to question my use of Publii as a blogging tool. I'm noticing it getting slower the more I write, and I haven't written that much. I'm also wanting a mobile option for posting and there's none of that on the horizon. Since I'm spending so much time in Logseq these days, I might try out the Hugo integration and see if it's just as easy. I wouldn't mind having all this backed up in my primary note taking system, and Logseq has a great mobile app.</p>
<p>Kid 5's team won their soccer game today. They're undefeated this season and even running up the score a little bit. I think they've allowed one goal in 3-4 games. We're talking 9 year olds here, but their confidence is off the charts after being together for several years. They're fun to watch.</p>
<p>Astronomy outreach event tonight. This is my favorite part of the hobby, and this time of year it's even better with all the amazement at seeing Saturn through a telescope for the first time. I'm overdoing it, as usual, taking my 12" Dob, 8" Celestron, and binoculars, but what's the point of having this stuff if you don't use it to inspire the next generation of astronomy nerds?</p>
<p>Finally feeling back to normal after being sick for three days. It wasn't COVID, but it sure felt like it. </p>

                <p>I did not sleep well last night. This morning I feel like the dead, but I'm going to power through it. Too many stimulants yesterday to make me functional for my in-office day must have taken their toll.</p>
<p>I'm really taking a liking to Logseq. Now that I've got the basics down, I'm moving quickly through my daily journaling and keeping track of my to-dos. One of them is a daily reminder to write this post. It worked, obviously.</p>
<p>I ordered a copy of the National Geographic Stargazer's Atlas. I'm more excited than I should be for a book. Nerd-mode engaged.</p>
<p>My recently moved-out teenager finally found a decent job, and might have an apartment soon. He doesn't give a lot of details and I don't ask, but I'm certainly proud of him. This is huge progress over where he was a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, life is much calmer without him in the house. We all needed space. It's not easy on a family when they have to deal with another member's trauma, particularly when they don't want to help themselves. I think being on his own has been a net positive.</p>

<p>It was another day in the office. I was oddly productive. I'll have to consult my scientists to see why that might be.</p>
<p>I was able to work a lot with Logseq today and really enjoyed it. I'm getting some of the basic keyboard commands down, in addition to building a habit of logging things more. Tonight Kid 5 and I made a list of some cabins we would like to visit and created <a href="https://davidwk.io/cabins-we-like/">this page</a> to keep track. We generated the Markdown in Logseq and exported it here.</p>

When digging through the available plugins I found one for ChatGPT. Now, I don't think what we're calling "AI" these days is actually AI. There's no real intelligence there, and these systems aren't thinking for themselves. We've just gotten very good at training these large language models to write text that sounds like a person wrote it. But what we CAN do is still pretty cool. Here's an example of the output you get when I asked it to write a summary for "The Uncanny Counter".</p>

                <p>Yesterday I finally got back into the astronomy groove. After dreading the thought that it might cost another couple hundred dollars to fix the mount on which I already spent hundreds of dollars, I took a closer look at the issue and found it was simply a gear on the RA motor that had been knocked slightly out of place. A few minor adjustments and everything was back in working order. After months of anxiety and doubt about whether or not to continue with this often frustrating hobby, finally a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>That led to a fun evening of public outreach with the astronomy club. Despite an unfortunate setup site location (we can't see through trees, folks) we had a good turnout for the event at Miami Whitewater Forest. Lots of kids and families with a lot of interest. A few gasps from those who stayed late enough to see Saturn. One family almost "bought" a member's telescope when their kid tried to yeet (as the young people say) the tube backwards off the mount. A friendly but stern talking-to settled anyone else who might have been too amped-up about the universe.</p>
<p>This means that tonight, weather permitting, I'll be able to setup the full rig with the camera and get back into EAA (electronically assisted astronomy - pictured above). The goal is to get the setup reliable enough that I can use it for public events. Polar alignment is the main issue as my process hasn't been very consistent so far. I should be able to pick up where I was and get some decent live images like below.</p>

<p>I did a rare thing last night. I stayed up past my bedtime to go to a movie. "The Equalizer 3" was two hours of gore and violence punctuated by Denzel Washington being an absolute bad-ass. </p>
<p>Tonight will be public astronomy outreach at a local park. Saturn should be amazing if we have clear skies. This will be my first time setting up a telescope in a while. I hope everything still works.</p>

Later this month we get "A Time Called You" which, if the trailer is accurate, is going to destroy a lot of us fans, emotionally speaking.</p>
<p>And on the subject of South Korea, my favorite country I've never been to, I read a fairly alarming article about how the birth rate, which is already the lowest in the world, has dropped once again. Science says a population needs a fertility rate of over 2% to sustain itself. South Korea's stands at 0.78%. Yikes! <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/worlds-lowest-birthrate-sinks-further-despite-cash-payouts-to-parents-23a92210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the article</a>.</p>
<p>It's a long weekend here in the US. It's Labor Day, which is traditionally the holiday dumb-ass Trumpers confuse with Memorial Day. That means we can expect the usual deluge of "While you're stuffing your face at a cookout you libtards better not forget the soldiers who died so you could have the day off!" posts. (FYI libtards is their word, not mine. I'm just using it to accurately represent the level of maturity in their social media.)</p>
<p>I've been contemplating my career a bit lately, mostly as a result of my (first at this company) bad review from last year. A whole plethora (do you know what a plethora is?) of circumstances culminated in that particular situation, including some mental health setbacks. However there was some feedback from a peer on that review that was entirely false. I guess I was naive to think I'm too old to make enemies at work. But to the point, I've been considering whether or not I'm in the right role for myself at this point in time. It doesn't bring me the sense of accomplishment that it once did. I don't want to leave the company at all - it's a great place to work. But it's big enough that I could find something else that might make me happier. </p>
<p>Yesterday the weather was so nice that, for a moment, I forgot about how fucked we are for continuing to destroy the environment. Please visualize that GIF of Nicolas Cage smiling, wind blowing through his hair in "Con-Air" for context. Watching Kid 5's soccer practice was a little less skin-cancerish for once.</p>

                    Today was "medicine check" day with my psychiatrist. Switched things up a little bit because I'm still in kind of a recovery mode from my terrible '22.

                <p>Today was "medicine check" day with my psychiatrist. Switched things up a little bit because I'm still in kind of a recovery mode from my terrible '22. With the right kind of stimulant, I'm the person I want to be - confident, pro-active, productive, outgoing. Vyvanse, the stuff I was taking before, was total shit for me. It did nothing but increase my anxiety and dull my personality. </p>
<p>I don't know how it's possible, but I lost 5 more pounds. I'm still in fat-ass territory, but I'm lucky to be at this point with the way I've been eating lately. I wish there was a coma diet. Just put me under for a couple months and feed me intravenously. </p>
<p>Yesterday in the office was pretty good. Got to meet some people face to face for the first time, saw a few work friends, and saw a lot of people from my old team. Free food was a bonus. It's a shame, though...they completely remodeled the office with all this great collaboration equipment, but it rarely gets used. Not that I want to go back full time (the drive sucks), but I hate to see it go to waste.</p>
<p>It's a story too long to tell, but I've been dealing with a charge for training that I wasn't supposed to pay for. My part was $400, but through a series of unfortunate clicks, I paid $3600. The refund is somewhere between PayPal and my bank, a kind of purgatory that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. </p>
<p>I'm diving deeper into automation with Power Automate and Teams at work. Not my job, but a skill that really helps me streamline things for my team. Going to start taking some training and impress the shit out of people.</p>
<p>Fun note: go check out <a href="https://ideogram.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ideogram.ai</a>. It's a pretty good AI picture generator. The logo for my site was created with it, as was the featured image for this post.</p>

                    On Wednesdays we go to the office. At least that's what I'm doing starting today. Ever since the pandemic I've been 100% work from home. While that appeals to my introverted leanings, it's proven over time to not be a healthy way to exist. I like the people I work&hellip;

                <p>On Wednesdays we go to the office. At least that's what I'm doing starting today. Ever since the pandemic I've been 100% work from home. While that appeals to my introverted leanings, it's proven over time to not be a healthy way to exist. I like the people I work with and I enjoy seeing them, but it's mentally and physically exhausting. I already have to medicate extensively to be a functional human being, what with the bi-polar, ADHD, and raging social anxiety. Being around people exasperates that 10 times over. I know a lot of people can relate to having bad brain chemistry. It sucks, but we survive.</p>
<p>Everyone in the house but me has colds. Part of me wants to check into a hotel so I don't have to be around a group of "patient zeroes". The other part of me thinks I'm probably playing it up a bit. </p>
<p>I've not been watching my diet very much (translated - at all) lately. I haven't stepped on a scale in a couple of months, either. I was doing pretty well at 20 lbs. lost, but I feel like I've been stress-eating. I should probably do something about the situation, but I'm not going to lie and say I'm feeling motivated to. I feel like I'm mentally in a rut...not happy with myself, but not yet prepared to move forward. Mental health is weird.</p>
<p>Time to get ready to make the drive to work. At this point I'm stalling. Happy Wednesday!</p>
