                <p>I’m a HUGE fan of South Korean television, more commonly referred to as “K-Drama”. It started with “Squid Game”, but it didn’t take me long to deep-dive into the enormous K-Drama library on Netflix. “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” was the show that really hooked me. Since then, most of my streaming time has been spent on South Korean television. </p>
<p>I’m going to be slowly expanding this list to include my thoughts on each show, and I’ll be using tags to help others sort through them and find things they like. For now, and without any spoilers, here are some quick recommendations. Unless specified otherwise, these are all available on Netflix in the US.</p>
<p><strong>My Personal Favorite</strong> - Extraordinary Attorney Woo</p>
<p><strong>RomCom Shows</strong> - Because This is My First Life, Romance is a Bonus Book</p>
<p><strong>Dramatic Love Stories</strong> - Twenty-Five Twenty-One, Rain or Shine</p>
<p><strong>Supernatural Shows</strong> - The Uncanny Counter, Tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>Action Dramas</strong> - My Name, The Glory</p>
